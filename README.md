## üìñ About This Repository

This repository serves as a portfolio of my work throughout the NTI MEAN Stack Training program. It documents my progress and showcases the practical application of concepts ranging from fundamental web technologies to advanced full-stack development with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js).

The tasks are organized by day, demonstrating a clear and structured learning path from basic JavaScript and DOM manipulation to building complex back-end APIs and front-end applications.
